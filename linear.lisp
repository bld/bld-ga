;; Linear functions
#|
Development notes:
Purpose is to define linear functions of multivectors and those functions determinants, adjoints, & inverses.
May want these as methods, so they can be specialized via BLD-GAGEN.
How to do this?
Need knowledge of the geometric algebra used, so the pseudoscalar and a unit vector basis can be used to calculate the determinant, adjoint, and inverse.
Within a linear function this can be done, because the GA object is the argument. How then to do this when the argument IS the function?
Maybe.... use closures for the basic function, but define a top-level method using it.
Annoying that methods aren't 1st class objects.
Really, need linear functions as 1st-class objects, so I can pass them around and operate on them.
Can I produce simplified versions after the fact, then, in BLD-GAGEN? Perhaps, via typecase within the functions?
I needed to make a special generation macro for GRADEN, because of the grade dependency.
Or not. The linear functions could just be closures. They all take only one argument, and map GA objects to ones of the same grade.
Inverse is proving problematic, because it is
